This is a I2C driver for SSD1306 OLED displays including graphics library. The project as is runs on the PSOC Analog Coprocessor Kit CY8CKIT-048.


The graphics library part (gfx_ functions) is a heavily modified version of the Adafruit graphics library,

No license restrictions on my part, do whatever you want as long as you follow the derived license requirements for the graphics library part.

Usage:


- Choose the 2 pins to be used for the I2C bus and connect the display to it and VCC/GND.

- Don’t forget to add pull-up resistors to SDA and SCL (something like 2.2k to 10k)

- configure OLED.cydwr for the I2C pins used
- build/program/run project

- Initialize display, see example code in main.c

Examples:


- see main.c for example usage


- see ssd1306.h for the entire API
